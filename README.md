# Shape Reader in Dart 🎨

Welcome to the Shape Reader, a sleek Dart application that reads shapes from a file and calculates their areas with elegance and precision.

## What's Inside? 📦

- `Shape`: An abstract class that defines the blueprint for all shapes.
- `Rectangle` & `Square`: Concrete classes that implement the `Shape` interface, providing specific calculations for their areas.
- `readShapeFromFile`: A futuristic async function that reads shape dimensions from a file and brings the shapes to life.

## Quick Start 🚀

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `dart run` to see the magic happen!

## Features ✨

- **Type Safety**: Leveraging Dart's robust type system for error-free code.
- **Asynchronous File I/O**: Reading files without blocking the main thread.
- **Polymorphism**: Showcasing object-oriented principles in action.

## How to Use 🛠️

Simply create a text file named `shape.txt` with the following format:

<width-of-rectangle><height-of-rectangle>
<side-length-of-square>


Run the program, and watch as it calculates and prints the areas of a rectangle and a square read from the file.
